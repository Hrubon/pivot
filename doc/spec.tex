\chap Terminals

\sec Web UI

\begitems\style a
* Web UI is a terminal, too.
* HTTP/2 server push to update content periodically if the client supports it,
  legacy polling mechanism otherwise
* JavaScript-based drag`n'drop UI to rearrange the nodes with possibly other
  ergonomic features.
* Fundamental operation of the Web UI (e.g. display/export of network map)
  must operate correctly without JavaScript support.
* Overall goal: leverage modern web technologies to provide value, not to bother.

\secc Object Rearrangement

\begitems\style a
* Objects representing nets and routers can be moved. The relocation of an object
  results in a request being sent to the server, the object is then affixed to
  this position on the map.
* Upon next request/on next push update the client receives the new map where
  the object in question has assumed its new position.
* No intelligence in the redrawing of the map on the client, that's Graphviz's
  job to do.
* If an object has not been moved, its position is calculated by Graphviz
  (the |neato| layout engine in fact). If it has been moved before, its position
  is fixed. Such an object can be ``unpinned'' from the UI and will assume its
  calculated position in the future.
